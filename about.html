        <h2> First, a little history</h2>          
        <p>It began when the Spanish introduced wheat in Mexico, during the time of the Conquest. The grain was not only a Spanish staple food but it was also a religious necessity – the only grain that the Catholic Church recognized suitable for the making of Eucharist wafer. The indigenous population at first did not desire wheat—many believed it tasted bland. It was not until an inventive viceroy dipped his bread in hot chocolate, a custom that quickly caught on as it tasted better than simple bread. The people of Mexico never looked back.</p>

        <h2> Our goal is to preserve traditions</h2>          
        <p>In Mexico, the tradition of eating sweet pastries for breakfast or mid-afternoon snack, known as merienda, goes back to the 16th century. Pan dulce is considered to be a Mexican 
          cuisine even though its origins are European. The desire for sweetness in bread was put into practice and fulfilled when French influence took hold in Mexico in the 19th century. 
          It eventually helped to establish the Mexican baking tradition that has become one of the most inventive in the world. It our goal to continue valuing the Mexican culture through the preservation of this tradition.</p>
